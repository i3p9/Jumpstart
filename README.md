Jumpstart is a Webapp for installing/updating multiple macOS Applications at once.

Simply check the applications you want installed, press 'Generate Script' and then copy/paste the script to Terminal.app

It uses Homebrew, if you don't have homebrew it'll install it when the script is ran for the first time.
